Implement the SfM pipeline using fundamental matrix, PnP, and Bundle Adjustment for pose estimation and 3D reconstruction of a 3D scene (WPI Unity Hall for this project)
1. Classical approach is coded in the Wrapper.py in the Phase1 folder
   For faster execution at the time of evaluation, the x_tol and f_tol values for all scipy.optimize functions are kept at 1e-5, which can be changed to default 1e-8 or 1e-9 for better results

2. A program with hardcoded image indices is provided as Wrapper_hardcode.py
