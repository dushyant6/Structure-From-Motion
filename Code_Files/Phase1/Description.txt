The codebase is used to implement different modules of SfM pipeline such as:
Finding fundamental and estimation matrix
Estimation and disambiguation of camera pose, registration of next camera images
Estimation of other camera poses using Perspective n-Points (PnP)
3D reconstruction using linear and non linear triangulation
Refinment of poses and 3D mapping using bundle adjustment with help of visibility matrix
